# ATmega328p_Synth

This project will be a digital synthesizer that uses the ATmega326p (the chip on the Arduino and Arduino Nano, which I am currently using).

The goal is to only use plain C-code and write everything by myself. That means no Arduino IDE, no Arduino methods or defines and as few libraries as possible (I might use some for a screen).

AVR-GCC is used as a compiler and AVRDUDE to upload the code.

Right now this project is more about learning, but in the end I want it to be a synthesizer.

My main learning resources are:
